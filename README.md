# DerivePass

*Compute secure passwords without storing them anywhere*

## About

DerivePass - is Password Manager that never stores your passwords anywhere: not
in the Cloud, and not even locally! Instead, the passwords are generated
on-the-fly by using the Master Password and the combination of domain-name and
login. This way, the passwords are unique for each website and at the same time
compromising a single password does not compromise others.

The project is a [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) application, written in a
JavaScript language. The online version is hosted on [Now][now],
while the standalone version is an [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) app.

## Project setup

You'll need to download the dependencies to run DerivePass locally:

```
npm install
```

### Development

This command will start a local web-server, and will update the application
through hot-reload mechanism.

```
npm run serve
```

### Publishing

Every build is automatically deployed to [Now][now], and the latest master
commit lives at https://dev.derivepass.com/.

Manual builds could be triggered by:

```
npm run build
```

Electron builds:

```

```

...or just electron app (using the latest build output):

NOTE: requires `GH_TOKEN` env variable and appropriate developer certificates
